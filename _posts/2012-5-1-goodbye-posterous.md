Dear Posterous, 
I loved you (I still defend you in office arguments!). But then I got busy with work and we lost touch. But now that I'm in a role that requires a bit less coding and a bunch of plotting, I need to blog again just to sort my thoughts out. But you entered an arranged marriage with Twitter, and I've discovered gh-pages. I suppose there's no turning back. It was good while it lasted.
