Dear Posterous,  
<br>
I loved you (I still defend you in office arguments!). But then I got busy with work and we lost touch. Now I'm in a role that requires a bit less coding and a bunch of plotting (more Pinky and the Brain, less gnuplot), and I need to blog again just to sort my thoughts out, so I though of you. But in the time that's passed, you ran off with Twitter, and I've discovered gh-pages. I suppose there's no turning back. It was good while it lasted.
