title: The Making of OneHash
---

#{{ page.title }}

OneHash allows you to stream the audio and video directly from a torrent swarm. 

Take torrent information of any variety (torrent file, magnet link, info hash) and just put it after #, and the site will start to download the content, and let you watch or listen in your browse. 

Take the DJ Shadow BitTorrent bundle for example (definitely worth a listen). This is the url to the torrent file:
http://featuredcontent.utorrent.com/torrents/DJShadow-BitTorrent-b.torrent

To listen using OneHash, just append the torrent information after #  
http://onehash.com#http://featuredcontent.utorrent.com/torrents/DJShadow-BitTorrent-b.torrent

You can of course enjoy the same torrent content using just the info hash:  
http://onehash.com#DFD0A2D3D2AD601388900A344507BA368D56ACE2

There are still some kinks to be worked out, as we're still fine tuning Torque's streaming capabilities, and HTML5 video/audio support remains even in flux, but its easy to see the potential here.
