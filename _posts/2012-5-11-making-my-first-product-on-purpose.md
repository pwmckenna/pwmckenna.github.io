title: Making My First Product On Purpose
---

#{{ page.title }}

On March 29th of this year (my birthday...glad I didn't skip work) I had the great pleasure of meeting Marty Cagan and listening to him share his insights on product development. And those two days turned product development from an art, to a science, in my mind.

In an effort to turn myself into a one man product creation wrecking ball, I've done a bunch of supplemental research to augment my Cagan experience.

I like this guy's style  

  
I'm in a pretty good place at work to give this a go. I'll lead the charge and let you know how it goes.
