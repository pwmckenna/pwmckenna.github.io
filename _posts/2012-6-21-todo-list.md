#{{ page.title }}

* Write liquid extension to be used with jekyll that automatically converts keywords in text to links to github repos.

* Write a version of backbrace that does what I want it to do. (live/die)  
__UPDATE: Done! See [https://github.com/bittorrenttorque/backbrace](https://github.com/bittorrenttorque/backbrace)__

* Come up with a standard way of updating submodules

* Create git commit hooks that convert my .gitmodules from git@ to git:// so that GitHub pages work, but I can develop the submodules locally from within projects.
