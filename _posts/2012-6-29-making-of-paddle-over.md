For a bit of background, see [Building Torque](../../../2012/06/29/building-torque.html)...

__Torque__

An important tidbit about the Torque api that led to building [PaddleOver](http://paddleover.com), is the fact that you can use the Backbone library to connect to your local machine...or any other machine in the world. For instance, if you give me access, I can open a web page and play with files on your computer the exact same way that I could on my own computer. For the developer, it makes no difference.

__Engineer + Beer + Btapp.js__

Originally I wanted to write a file distribution management tool that would allow software companies to distribute files to their servers [the same way that Facebook does.](http://torrentfreak.com/facebook-uses-bittorrent-and-they-love-it-100625/) I was also getting pretty obsessed with [Bret Victor's]() work at the time, and thought that I'd take a swing at building an interface that was slightly more usable than [the last piece of software that I worked on.](http://filesharefreak.com/tutorials/utorrent-18x-advanced-settings-explained)

After taking advantage of the keg here at BitTorrent for a bit one night, I started trolling around domain registrars and scored the awesome domain [http://beamitover.com](). I was starting to envision a site simple enough to be used on a touch screen, with the asthetic of early Star Trek control panels. As this site was going to be showing off our api to other software devs, a sci-fi theme seem appropriate.

__But then we built it.__ And it was so fun and easy to use. And I realized that it might be the first thing I've ever built that my mom might enjoy using. I couldn't miss this opportunity.

Rebranding started with a gorgeous background by [James Gately](http://www.istockphoto.com/user_view.php?id=2715153). From there it was simply a matter of adding in a few easter eggs and calling it a day. The site is quite simple both in terms of the UI and whats happening under the hood. My hope is that there's a javascript dev out there that is inspired enough to take a peek at [btapp.js](http://github.com/bittorrenttorque/btapp) and build something themselves.

And I'll tell you what. Build something awesome and I'll just give you [http://beamitover.com](). It deserves a good home.
