#{{ page.title }}

Howdy all,

Today I'm happy to bring you [BeamItOver](http://apps.facebook.com/beamitover), the latest project from [BitTorrent Torque Labs](http://torque.bittorrent.com/labs).

It has the same functionality as some other [Torque Labs projects](http://paddleover.com), but its been designed from the ground up to bring the inherently social activity of sharing files to where the people are. Its a facebook app that aims to make sharing your files as simple as sharing anything else.

For developers out there [getting started](http://btappjs.com/index.html) building Torque apps, I'm hoping this can be an exciting example of the possiblities using our technologies. Like everything out of Torque Labs, this project is open source, and [available on github](https://github.com/bittorrenttorque/beamitover).

And for the more casual users, my hope is that you will embrace the meshing of your social activity with your file downloads. In the age of smart phones generating incredible amounts of data, and >1GB GoPro videos flying around, we really need a good way to share this stuff with our friends and family.

Anyhow, give it spin and let me know what you think! I'm available on [facebook](http://www.facebook.com/patriw), as well as twitter.
